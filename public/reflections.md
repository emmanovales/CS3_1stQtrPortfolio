## 5 Topics I Know Very Well
1. **Setting up a GitHub repository and committing changes.** - I can create a new repository on GitHub without problems. I can also clone it to my local machine, and make my first commit.
2. **Declaring variables and data types in JavaScript.** - I understand how to declare variables using var, let, and const. I can also identify different data types like strings, numbers, and booleans.
3. **Loop control structures (for, while, do-while).** - I can implement loops to iterate over data and perform actions multiple times. I know when to use each type of loop. 
4. **Declaring functions.** - I know how to declare functions using function expressions. I know how to pass parameters and return values from functions. 
5. **Using conditional statements (if, else if, else).** - I can use conditional statements to control the flow of my code based on certain conditions. I know how to work with conditions and use logical operators.

## 5 Topics I Know But Need More Practice In
1. **Loop control structures (for, while, do-while).** - While I understand the basics of loops, I know which type of loop to use in different scenarios, but I need more practice to become more comfortable with them.
2. **Loops within loops (nested loops).** - I understand the concept of nested loops, but I need more practice to effectively implement them in my code. Sometimes, I make syntax errors when trying to nest loops.
3. **Break statements.** - I know how to use break statements to exit loops early, but I need more practice to understand when and how to use them effectively in different scenarios. Sometimes, I forget to include them in my loops when needed.
4. **The switch statement.** - I understand the basic structure of switch statements, but I need more practice to use them effectively in my code. I sometimes struggle with the syntax and how to implement them correctly.
5. **Using loops to print patterns.** - I understand the concept of using loops to print patterns, but I need more practice to create complex patterns and understand how to manipulate loop variables to achieve the desired output. I often struggle with the triangle patterns using asterisks.

## Plan of action
I plan on focusing and dedacating more of my own time for doing practice problems that involve the topics I am having a bit of difficulty in dealing with. I will consult online sources and materials to aid in my studies, and I will also do all of this with my classmates so that we can help each other out and learn together as well.

## 2 Effective and 2 Ineffective Class Activities
**Effective Class Activities:**
1. **Coding Exercises:** The coding exercises we did in class were very effective. They allowed me to apply what I learned in a practical way and helped reinforce my understanding of the concepts. Not only that, but since it is conducted face-to-face, I can also ask the teacher for advice whenever I require help and can't code a part by myself.
2. **Lecture with Examples:** The lectures that included real-life examples were very effective. They helped me understand how the concepts we were learning could be applied in real-world scenarios. This made the material more relatable and easier to grasp.

**Ineffective Class Activities:**
1. **Quizizz:** The Quizizz activities were not very effective for me. While they were fun, I found that they didn't help me understand the material as deeply as other activities. I often felt rushed to answer questions quickly, which made it difficult to think through my responses. (But ma'am, please don't ever stop us from doing this,  because I really do enjoy the Quizizz activities. Just because they aren't as effective as the others doesn't mean that they are completely useless.)
2. **Coding Assignments without Guidance:** Some coding assignments were less effective when we were left to figure things out entirely on our own without any guidance. I found that I struggled more with these assignments and didn't learn as much as I would have with some support or hints along the way. Also, because it isn't  conducted face-to-face, I tend to search for the structures of the code so I know how to do it instead of figuring it out myself, which makes memorizing kind of harder that if I were to do it in class.
