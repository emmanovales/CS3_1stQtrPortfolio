   <p> 
      This is my first non-graded exercise to practice the use
      of variables and displaying results as pop-up dialog box or
      on the browser on the console.
   </p>
   <script>
        // let, var, const
        // declare variables
        let age=57;
        let maxAge = 100;
        let numPerDay = 5;
        // determine how many snacks needed until 100 year
        let totalRequired = (numPerDay * 365) * (maxAge - age); 
        // display on browser 
        document.write("You will need " + totalRequired + " to last you until the ripe old age of " + maxAge);
        alert(`Your will need ${totalRequired} to last you until the ripe old age of ${maxAge}`);
        console.log("You will need "+ totalRequired + " to last you until the ripe old age of " + maxAge);
   </script>
</body>
