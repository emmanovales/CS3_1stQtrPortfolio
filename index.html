      //let x = 10;
      //let isItTrue = true;
      //let y = 10.50
      //window.alert(`These are our values: \n ${x}, ${isItTrue}, ${y}`);
      //document.write(`These are our values: <br/> ${x}, ${isItTrue}, ${y}`);
      //console.log(`These are our values: \n${x}, ${isItTrue}, ${y}`);

      //use window.alert for windows, document.write or console.log for others.
      // \n is to make your next output go down to the next line, but is usually only used for text-based websites or smth like that so use </br/> instead i think.
      //$ not sure what it does but i think it makes your answer type out or smth like that.
